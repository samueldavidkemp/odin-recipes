    <h2>Fish Tacos</h2>
    <h3>These crispy fish tacos with shredded cabbage and a spicy homemade white sauce are just delicious! Serve with homemade pico de gallo and lime wedges to squeeze on top.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2 to 3 ounce portions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>
        <li>½ medium head cabbage, finely shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make beer batter: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend beer and egg in a separate bowl, then quickly stir into flour mixture until combined with a few lumps remaining.</li>
        <li>Make white sauce: Mix together yogurt and mayonnaise in a medium bowl. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny. Season with jalapeño, capers, cayenne, oregano, cumin, and dill.</li>
        <li>Start fish tacos: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Dust fish pieces lightly with flour. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip floured fish pieces into beer batter. Set aside</li>
        <li>Fry in hot oil until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Lightly fry tortillas in hot oil until just crisped, but not too crisp. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Place fried fish in tortillas; top with shredded cabbage and white sauce.</li>
    </ol>
